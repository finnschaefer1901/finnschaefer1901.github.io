# **Project**

On this page, all my projects are documented. This is not related to the [papers, thesis and Documentation](https://finnschaefer1901.github.io/pub/Publications); this is focused on the practical work.

## Cooperate Study
During my studies at DHBW Mannheim in cooperation with Deutsche Bahn Netz AG, I undertook various practical projects. Most of these projects in this field revolved around testing and validation. I participated in ultrasonic testing of ICE Trains, established the documentation system for a test laboratory, and contributed to a variety of tests for digital switch systems. In each practical phase, I was required to compose a scientific report detailing the current state of the art, foundational work, my own contributions, and potential future approaches.
Due to the IP of the topics discussed, which belong to DB Netz AG Zentrale, I am unable to publicly share these reports.

## Formula Student

### What is Formula Student (Driverless)
Formula Student is an international engineering championship where a variety of universities compete against each other. The primary objective is to design and construct a race car capable of competing against other universities in events held throughout the season. These events consist of both static and dynamic disciplines. The static events focus on knowledge presentation, covering not only technical aspects but also business-related topics. On the other hand, the dynamic disciplines involve racing, testing aspects such as lateral and longitudinal vehicle dynamics, as well as battery performance across various challenges.

### What did I do?
As a member of the Formula Student Driverless team, I was a part of [CURE Mannheim](https://curemannheim.de/). My primary responsibilities included developing a motion planning approach for our autonomous race car. I also contributed to the field of Model Predictive Control and served as the static lead of our autonomous subteam. We developed our own curvature-optimal planner, and you can find the basic concept and graphical explanations [here](https://finnschaefer1901.github.io/pub/Publications). Upon completing my active season and my bachelor's degree, I remained involved with the team, providing feedback on designs and implementations. I also guide current team members through their study theses.

## Indy Autonomous Challenge

### Monza Challenge 2023
The 2023 Monza Challenge was the inaugural Autonomous Road Course Competition of the Indy Autonomous Challenge, which had its first edition in October 2021 in Indianapolis. The objective of the Monza Challenge was to conduct timed racing laps for the first time on the Monza Formula 1 Track. The central concept involved providing each team with the same car, the ([Dallara AV-21](https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/racecar)). The Dallara AV-21 is a standard Indy Car that has been outfitted with a sensor stack to enable full autonomous operation. As of August 2023, one of these cars currently holds the world record for the [fastest autonomous race car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzj49NLTlcY). The 2023 Monza Challenge was organized as a race without overtaking (with overtaking most likely planned for Monza 2024).

### What I did at TUM Autonomous Motorsport
As a team member of TUM Autonomous Motor Sport, I participated as a planning team member in the 2023 Monza Challenge. My responsibility involved visualizing captured data and re-implementing a debugging tool for our new [local](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=R4wwim0AAAAJ&citation_for_view=R4wwim0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) and [global](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10954) planner approach.

## Private
My personal projects primarily involve data capture initiatives. Currently, I am in the process of developing a PCB using KiCAD that records various physical parameters from a standard car. The primary objective is to attain the capability to gauge the vehicle's dynamic performance and to establish a live telemetry system for it. This pursuit is largely driven by my fascination with automobiles and a general interest in performance measurement.
