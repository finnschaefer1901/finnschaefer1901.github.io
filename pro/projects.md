# **Project**

On this Page all my Projects are documented. This is not about the [papers, thesis and Documentation](https://finnschaefer1901.github.io/pub/Publications), this is about the work.

## Cooperate Study
Within my Studies at DHBW Mannheim in Cooperation with the Deutsche Bahn Netz AG I had different practical Projects. Most of the Projects i in this field were in the area of testing and validation. I participated in the field of ultrasonic testing of ICE Trains, Sat up the Documentation system for a test laboratory and took part in the a variety of tests for the digital pointsmen. Within every practical phase I had to write a scientific report about state of the art approaches, base work, what i developed and what can be approached in the future. Because the topics that were disscussed are IP of the DB Netz Ag Zentrale, I am not able to publish these reports.

## Formula Student

### What is Formula Student (Driverless)
Formula Student is an international construction championship. A verity of Universities is competing against each other.The main goal is to design and build a race car that can compete against other universities at the Events taking place during the season. You can distinguish between statics and dynamic disciplins at these events. The static events are more about presenting knowledge and not only technical but also in the field of buiseness. The dynamic disciplines are about racing. During the dynamic disciplines the lateral, longitudinal, vehicle dynamics and the battery power is tested in different disciplines.

### What did I do?
As a Formula Student Driverless Teammember I was part of [CURE Mannheim](https://curemannheim.de/). My main responsibilities we're to develop a Motion Planning approach for our autonomous Race Car. I also aided in the field of Model Predictive Control and was Static responsible of our autonomous subteam. Why we developped our own curvature optimal planner, the basic concept and some graphical explanation can be found [here](https://finnschaefer1901.github.io/pub/Publications). After finishing my active season when finishing my bachelors degree I stayed part of the team and gave feedback on Designs and Implementations. I am also guiding active team members through their study thesis.

## Indy Autonomous Challenge

### Monza Challenge 2023
The 2023 Monza Challenge was the first Autonomous Road Course Competition of the Indy Autonomous Challenge that 1st took place in October 2021 in Indianapolis. Goal of the Monza Challenge was to perform lap time racing for the first time on the Monza Formula 1 Track. The main Concept is that every Team gets the same car ([Dallara AV-21](https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/racecar)). The Dallata AV-21 is a normal Indy Car that got extended by a Sensor Stack for being able to operate fully autonomous. One of these Cars holds currently (08/2023) the world record for the [fastest autonomous race car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzj49NLTlcY). The 2023 Monza Challenge was a Challenge without overtaking (most likely planned for Monza 2024).

### What I did at TUM Autonomous Motorsport
As Teammember of TUM Autonomous Motor Sport I took part as a planning team member in the 2023 Monza Challenge. My responsability was to visualize captured data and to reimplement a debugging tool for our new [local](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=R4wwim0AAAAJ&citation_for_view=R4wwim0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) and [global](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10954) planner approach.

## Private
My personal projects are mainly projects for capturing Data. I am currently developing a PCB using KiCAD that captures different physical values of a normal car. The main goal is to be able to measure the vehicle dynamic performance of my own car. And for being able to have a live telemetry of it. This is mainly because of my interest in cars and performance measurement overall.
