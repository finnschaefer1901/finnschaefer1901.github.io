# **Project**

On this Page all my Projects are documented. This is not about the [papers, thesis and Documentation](https://finnschaefer1901.github.io/pub/Publications), this is about the work.

## Cooperate Study
Within my Studies at DHBW Mannheim in Cooperation with the Deutsche Bahn Netz AG I had different practical Projects. Most of the Projects i in this field were in the area of testing and validation. I participated in the field of ultrasonic testing of ICE Trains, Sat up the Documentation system for a test laboratory and took part in the a variety of tests for the digital pointsmen. Within every practical phase I had to write a scientific report about state of the art approaches, base work, what i developed and what can be approached in the future. Because the topics that were disscussed are IP of the DB Netz Ag Zentrale, I am not able to publish these reports.

## Formula Student
As a Formula Student Driverless Teammember I was part of [CURE Mannheim](https://curemannheim.de/). My main responsibilities we're to develop a Motion Planning approach for our autonomous Race Car. I also aided in the field of Model Predictive Control and was Static responsible of our autonomous subteam. Why we developped our own curvature optimal planner, the basic concept and some graphical explanation can be found [here](https://finnschaefer1901.github.io/pub/Publications).

## TUM Autonomous Motor Sport
As Teammember of TUM Autonomous Motor Sport I took part as a planning team member in the 2023 Monza Challenge. My responsability was to visualize captured data and to reimplement a debugging tool for our new [local](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=R4wwim0AAAAJ&citation_for_view=R4wwim0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) and [global](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10954) planner approach.

## Private
My personal projects are mainly projects for capturing Data. I am currently developing a PCB that captures different physical values of a normal car, captures and stores them. The main goal is to be able to measure the vehicle dynamic performance of my own car. And for being able to have a live telemetry of my own car. This is mainly because of my interest in cars and performance measurement overall.
